#A Three.js Music Visualizer

This visualizer was built as a school project. It displays 3D-bars that correspond to the frequency of music or sound and tracks an ArUco marker.

###To use the demo
You must have a camera to use this demo. It has been tested with on a laptop and android phone.


Print out or open [the QR code] (https://github.com/Nishnha/ThreeJS-Visualizer/blob/gh-pages/aurco_265.png) and go to [the demo page] (http://nishnha.github.io/ThreeJS-Visualizer). When prompted for camera use, hit accept.

Hold the QR code in front of the camera and the music visualizer will appear! Checking "Enable floating objects" will keep any objects from disappearing if the marker is not detected.

Click on "Choose File" to choose a song, or click on "Use your microphone!" to use your microphone.
