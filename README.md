#Three.js Music Visualizer (mostly)

This visualizer was built as a school project, which is why it has unrelated features like the hazard button which demos possible industrial use of augmented reality.

###To use the demo

You must have a camera to use this demo. It's been tested on PC and Androi and does NOT work with iPhones.

Print out or open the [QR cod] (https://github.com/Nishnha/ThreeJS-Visualizer/blob/gh-pages/aurco_265.png) and go to [the demo page] (http://nishnha.github.io/ThreeJS-Visualizer). When prompted for camera use, accept.

To use the AR features hold the QR code in front of the camera and a music visualizer will appear! Checking "Enable floating objects" will keep any objects from disappearing if the marker is not detected. "Show hazzards!" is a demo of possible industrial use for augmented reality technology.

Click on "Choose File" to change the song from the default to your own, or click on "Use your microphone!" to, well... use your microphone.

###To be added:
- non-AR demo (already built, check visualizer branch )
- reactive backdrop
- removal of global variables, general code cleanup
